= LiquiDoc CMF

This repo contains the boilerplate files for, and rudimentary documentation of, a content mamanagement framework (CMF) for combining open-source tools and workflows for documentation management.
LiquiDoc CMF (LDCMF) incorporates two excellent lightweight markup languages (link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] and link:https://github.com/darvid/trine/wiki/YAML-Primer[YAML]) with open-source build and publish utilities (link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics[Git], link:http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor], link:http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/02/27/static-site-generators-start-to-displace-online-cmss/[static site generators], build and deployment tools, and many others) using a wrapper utility called link:https://github.com/briandominick/liquidoc-gem[*LiquiDoc*].
This creates a truly open, highly portable system for developing and maintaining docs code the way programmers develop and maintain product code.

== Usage

Complete documentation for LDCMF is still being developed.

The following procedure is a *bootstrapping operation* to get an _actual LDCMF project_ started.
It further sets up initial files based on custom preferences.
The newly generated `README.adoc` instructs future users to set up and use your docs.

=== Quickstart

[WARNING]
This file (`README.adoc`) is the README for the generic LiquiDoc CMF project bootstrap repository.
If you wish to keep this file, move/rename it _before_ running the quickstart, which generates a proper `README.adoc` for your actual docs project/directory, which this directory and its contents then becomes.

If you have link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git] and link:https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/[Ruby runtime] installed, you can get going with LiquiDoc CMF in a few quick steps.

. Clone this repo.
+
[subs="quotes"]
----
git clone git@github.com:DocOps/liquidoc-cmf.git *docs_dir*
----
+
Replace `docs_dir` with the directory name you want to give this directory.

. Change to the project directory.
+
.Example
----
cd docs_dir
----

. Re-associate your files with the proper repository.

.. _If this project is its own Git repo_, change the project's remote origin Git repository.
+
----
git remote set-url origin git://github.com:your-project/your-repo-name.git
----
+
Replace this URI with your own.

.. _If this project is part of a parent directory's Git repo_, remove local Git files.
+
----
rm -rf .git
----

. Run Bundler to install dependencies.
+
----
bundle install
----
+
If Bundler is not installed, run `gem install bundler`, then repeat this command.

. Rename this README so _init_ does not overwrite it.
+
.Example
----
mv README.adoc README.meta.adoc
----

. Edit your project metafile.
+
In your favorite text/code editor, open `_data/meta.yml` and fill out the required info, then *save the file*.

. Run LiquiDoc with the LDCMF initialization config.
+
----
bundle exec liquidoc -c _init/init.yml
----

. You can now review and edit your `README.adoc` and `src/index.adoc` files with custom content.

. Delete or move the `README.meta.adoc` file (this file) and the `_init/` directory, which you will no longer need.

Further instructions are in your new README!
The new README file is oriented for your project's future users, so you don't need to repeat setup steps.
Just run your first build.
