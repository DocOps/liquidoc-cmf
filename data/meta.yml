# The products/technologies documented by THIS docs project, as a phrase:

# The space_type refers to where/how THIS project resides, either:
# * repo   | Docs have their own repository with no parent.
# * colo   | Docs are collocated inside the product repository.
# Note:    Docs with their own repo may contain product repos as submodules.
#          For collocated (colo) setups, this project may have its own folder
#           or reside in a submodule (subordinate repository).
space_type: repo

# The subj_rel defines how THIS docs repo relates to the documented subjects:
# * parent    | Products are all submodules of the docs (recommended)
# * submod    | Docs are in a Git submodule subordinate to all product repos
# * folder    | Docs are in a dir w/in the (solely documented) product repo.
# * none      | The product repo and docs repo are technically unrelated.
# * mashup    | It's complicated.
