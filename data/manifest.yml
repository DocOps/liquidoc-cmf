# Optional file
# This is the clearinghouse datasource for content metadata
# Formerly data/schema.yml in some projects, manifest.yml
#  is the central map or index file coordinating data
#  when necessary.
#
# Its structure is like so:
#
# pages:
#   - slug: some-page-slug
#     title: Some Page Title
#     title_short: A Page
#     guides: [one,two]
#     categories: [cat1,cat2,cat3]
#
# topics:
#   - slug: some-topic-slug
#     title: Some Topic Title
#     title_short: A Topic
#     guides: [one,two]
#     subtopics:
#       - another-topic
#       - yet-another-topic
#   - slug: another-topic
#     title: A Child Topic of Some Topic Title
#     title_short: A Topic's Kid
#     guides: [one]
#   - slug: yet-another-topic
#     title: A Child of Some Topic Title
#     title_short: A Topic's Kid
#     guides: [two]
#
## In this example, two guides are being built
## ("one" and "two"). The page associated with
## some-page-slug will build for both guides,
## as will the first topic: some-topic-slug.
## However, each "child" of some-topic-slug will
## only build for one guide. The relationships
## will stay tracked for both.
## LDCMF can accommodate three tiers of nested
## topics in portal output. Guides will either
## 1. make child topic headers subordinate;
## 2. string all topics sequentially as peers; or
## 3. dump child topics into links to portal version
## 4. anything else you want to program
#
#
# categories:
#   - slug: some-subject
#     name: Some Broad Subject
#     desc: Where we put stuff about Somes
#   - slug: another-subject
#     name: Another Broad Subject
#     desc: Where we put stuff about Anothers
# domains:
#   - slug: setup
#   - name: Setup and Installation
#   - slug: extending
#     name: Extending the Product
# types:
#   - slug: task
#     key: t
#   - slug: concept
#     key: c
#   - slug: reference
#     key: r
#   - slug: index
#     key: i
#   - slug: example
#     key: x
# volumes:
## LiquiDoc Volumes are like Jekyll collections, only
## organized in the manifest rather than the file
## structure, for objective metadata.
